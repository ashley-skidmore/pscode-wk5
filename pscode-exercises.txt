// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
LOOP:
	INPUT number
	divide number by 2
	IF remainder = 0
		PRINT even
		ELSE print odd


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

LOOP:
	INPUT number1, number2, number3, number4, number5
	Add number1, number2, number3, number4, number 5
		Define result as sum
	Define number1 as smallest
	Consider each of the other numbers
		IF it is less than smallest
		Define as smallest
		ELSE consider next number
	Define number1 as largest
	Consider each of the other numbers
		IF it is greater than largest
		Define as largest
		ELSE consider next number
	PRINT sum = (value of sum)
	PRINT smallest = (value of smallest)
	PRINT largest = (value of largest)
